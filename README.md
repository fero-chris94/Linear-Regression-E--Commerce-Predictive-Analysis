# Linear Regression: An E-Commerce Predictive Analysis
This is a Repository illustrating Linear Regression on an E-Commerce Data Set




# About the DataSet
The dataset contains information about customers who purchase clothes online from a store that provides in-store style and clothing advice sessions. The customers visit the store for personalized sessions with a personal stylist and then have the option to place orders using either a mobile app or the website.

To help the company make an informed decision on where to focus their efforts, the dataset includes various variables that capture customer behavior and preferences. Some key factors that are included in the dataset are:
- **Email Address**: The unique email address associated with each customer.
- **Avatar**: The customer's chosen avatar or profile picture.
- **Avg. Session Length**: The average duration of the in-store style and clothing advice sessions attended by customers.
- **Time on App**: The amount of time (in minutes) spent by customers on the mobile app.
- **Time on Website**: The amount of time (in minutes) spent by customers on the website.
- **Length of Membership**: The number of years the customer has been a member of the store.
- **Yearly Amount Spent**: The total amount of money (in currency) spent by the customer on purchases annually.
